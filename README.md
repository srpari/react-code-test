LIVE DEMO : https://react-test-tymeshift.vercel.app/

Implement small react application that will display "All locations" page. Clicking on a specific location should display a modal with all the properties of that single location. Modal should be closable.

Locations on main "All locations" page are displayed with a card showing some of the location properties. 
Every location card should also contain a section "Views:", displaying the real number next to it. 
Default starting value is 0. 
Every time the user clicks on a location to display its properties, number of views should increase by 1.
